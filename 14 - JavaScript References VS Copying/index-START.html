    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);
    //As a result, this updates the original array as well! We need to make a copy for the arrays!

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //When you pass the slice method with no input, it creates a copy of that array without any reference.
    //So this gets around the reference problem we had above.

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
    	name: 'Enes Kirimi',
    	age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.age = 99;
    //console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99});
    console.log(cap2); //Now it's not updated in the original!

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const cap3 = {...person}; //Same as above! But be warned that it will only go one level!

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    //You can also do a poor man's deep clone with JSON.parse. It's not recommended to use this.
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
